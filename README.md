My start-up app which is yet to reach to the market.

### Pain point ###
Waiting for an excessive amount of time for a haircut (especially for men), even when youâ€™ve been a regular customer at the same place for years. 

### App description ###
There is currently no platform to bridge the gap between a hair stylist and a customer. If a hair salon cannot be found on an online platform for appointment booking, managing the timing of both salons and customers can be very time-consuming. That is why this application was created to give both parties a platform and serve as a mediator. Customers can schedule an appointment with a stylist for hair treatment, nails, or other cosmetic needs.
