### App name: shortKut ###

### App description ###
There is currently no platform to bridge the gap between a hair stylist and a customer. If a hair salon cannot be found on an online platform for appointment booking, managing the timing of both salons and customers can be very time-consuming. That is why this application was created to give both parties a platform and serve as a mediator. Customers can schedule an appointment with a stylist for hair treatment, nails, or other cosmetic needs.
